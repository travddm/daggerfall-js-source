// surface for hosts that own a motor but had NO weapon - the interior
// mode and both exterior walk hosts (the weapon-audit follow-up: "the
// voxel path was dungeon-only too"). Every law here mirrors the
// AUDITED dungeon implementation (dungeonContext.js) verbatim:
// WeaponManager's sheathe/ShowWeapons legs, FPSWeapon's bow guards,
// the drag-to-swing gesture seam, the swing-sound edge, and the
// WeaponEnvDamage swing ray. dungeonContext keeps its own inline copy
// FOR NOW - that file is the parallel FP lane's active surface and
// has conflicted on every merge today; folding it onto this rig is a
// recorded residual (Combat.md), not an accident.

// a12: and the HAND. The rig is where WeaponManager's per-frame
// UpdateHands/ApplyWeapon pair lands (syncWorn) and where SwitchHand's
// release edge arrives (switchHand); the state and the laws themselves
// are playerWeapon's.
//
// Hosts without foes still get the full classic feel: ready/sheathe
// on Z (DrawWeapon 78 on unsheathing a real weapon), H to switch the
// swinging hand, RMB drag or
// click to swing with the pitch-matched swing sound, bows consuming
// an Arrow per loose with the zero-arrow auto-sheathe, and the
// optional environment-attack ray (interiors: bash/Receive on action
// objects; open exteriors have nothing in reach).

      // the classic spellcasting hands were hoisted above it ("NOT under shown() - the weapon is the thing shown()
      // hides") - and its `sheathed` leg was taking the carried light down with the weapon. A player walking around
      // with a torch and nothing drawn is sheathed by definition, so the one state the light exists for was the one
      // state it never drew in.
      //
      // BOTH references say it should. Handheld Torches' own hand law leaves "an empty hand you are not swinging
      // with" free precisely so a weaponless player can carry a light (HT7's note, and its `hasFreeHand`); and the
      // Morrowind rig answers it outright - `carriedLeftVisible(animWeaponType(type, sheathed, spellReady))` is
      // NpcAnimation::updateCarriedLeftVisible verbatim, and a sheathed stance maps to None, which is not
      // two-handed, so the carried left is VISIBLE. The same law answers FALSE for a readied spell, which is why
      // that leg of shown() must keep hiding it.
      //
      // So: the lit hand alone draws while merely sheathed. The other two legs stand - a readied spell is the
      // reference's own hidden case, an equip countdown is empty hands by construction - and paralysis, third
      // person and the EOTB body still take everything, above.

      // question as "will anything actually appear". On the Morrowind lane the arm paints the light itself, and
      // its held-light art is the TORCH alone (`isLitTorch` above - the classic lane's hand sprite covers the
      // lantern, as it always has), and a rig can resolve no light at all (no LIGH record, no attached mesh, no
      // Shield Bone). Opening the gate on those would paint a sheathed idle holding NOTHING where the screen used

      // lane needs no veto - `handheld.draw` asks the same question itself and returns false.

      // WHAT DOES COME BACK WITH THE TORCH, said accurately: on the CLASSIC lane, nothing - `torchOnly` returns
      // below, before the widget's clone and before the sprite. On the MORROWIND lane the arm returns above that
      // line and paints its own stance, which hides the weapon in the settled sheathed state - but NOT during the
      // unequip transient, where the rig deliberately keeps the blade in hand until the detach key. So sheathing
