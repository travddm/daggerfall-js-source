// @ts-check
// EG-G2: THE ONE REGISTRY OF PSEUDO-ARCHIVES - every texture archive the port answers that is not one of
// Daggerfall's own TEXTURE.000-511, in one place, so a new one is picked against all the others and never on top of one.
//
// A picture is kept by its archive and its record (renderer.uploadTexture(archive, record, ...)), so two owners that
// pick one number share every picture under it: whichever uploads first stands for both. That happened once (AUDIT SD IV
// R6: the large boat took 38151, the Shattered Hour's own, and was moved to 38171), and the numbers were scattered
// constants with nothing to say which were taken. Four kinds live here:
//   port       - painted in code by the port (bloodArt.js's law, BLOOD_ATLAS_ARCHIVE 38001, and every made level since);
//   mod        - a mod's own archive the port carries (Handheld Torches, the shields, Eye Of The Beholder, the waves);
//   data       - a number Daggerfall's own block data names that no catalogue holds, which the port answers with a
//                stand-in (the towns' clutter and gardens) - never to be taken by a picture of ours;
//   synthetic  - a number the port mints at runtime (the peers' dolls).
// A string key (`'cards'`, `'hcc'`) is a pseudo-archive too - the renderer keys a picture by `${archive}_${record}`, so a
// string can collide only with a string - and is registered beside the numbers.
//
// Each owner keeps its own constant (its module, its pins); this registry says the number is taken and by whom, and
// test/world/eglook_registry.test.js sweeps the source both ways - every `*ARCHIVE*` constant past TEXTURE.511 in src/ is
// registered here at its own value and owner, every registered constant still stands in its owner - and refuses any two
// entries that overlap.
//
//
// A leaf: no imports. Not a DFU member. Ledger A (ELITE-GATES).
